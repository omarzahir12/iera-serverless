The reason behind that is if you are willing to spread the word of Allah and His messenger, you need to learn the religion in a proper way at least the basics so that you are confident enough to motivate others through your actions. ","After immigrating to Canada, I learned more about the deen and wanted to enhance my limited knowledge of religion since childhood. Therefore, I was looking for an opportunity to learn and get the skills through training and some practice to gain confidence in speaking, through which I can be a part of any Dawah team in my area. Fortunately, when I heard about the interfaith event at the Umma Masjid, I was excited to volunteer in the event, and I was excited to hear that there would be some workshop/training will be provided. From there, I first heard about iERA and joined the workshop sessions before the event.

This experience has allowed me to develop strong communication and interpersonal skills, as well as the ability to adapt my teaching methods to meet the unique needs of each student. Moreover, I have provided counseling to students regarding their university pathways, helping them make informed decisions about their academic and career goals.  In addition to academic mentoring, I have also been actively involved in a tutoring club where I initiated and organized tutoring sessions for students. This role has honed my leadership and organizational abilities, as well as provided me with opportunities to support and mentor students in their learning journey.  Furthermore, I participated in a program where I served as a mentor to students while engaging in physical activities. This experience allowed me to provide guidance and support to students not only academically, but also in fostering their physical and mental well-being.  Drawing upon these experiences, I am confident in my ability to excel as an Islamic Student Mentor. My previous mentoring roles have equipped me with the necessary skills to provide guidance, support, and encouragement to students in their Islamic studies. I am passionate about creating a nurturing and inclusive environment for students to thrive academically, emotionally, and spiritually.","As a current student pursuing a degree in Health Sciences and possessing a strong background in research, I believe I would be an excellent fit for this opportunity.  Throughout my academic journey at the University of Waterloo, I have actively participated in various research projects in the medical field. Notably, I had the privilege of working as an ophthalmology clinic intern under the supervision of Dr. Bhatti, where I contributed to a study on Macular Telangiectasia type 2 in a young woman. This experience instilled in me the values of meticulous attention to detail, effective organization, and the ability to work independently. Furthermore, it provided me with valuable skills in data analysis, presentation, and collaborative teamwork.  Additionally, I have gained practical experience through internships at iCare Surgical Centre, an ophthalmology clinic, and the University of Waterloo. These internships have granted me hands-on exposure to statistical analysis and various research methodologies, enabling me to develop a strong foundation in research and further fueling my passion for a career in this field.  With my skills and experience, I am confident that I would make a valuable contribution as an Islamic Student Mentor. I am genuinely excited about the prospect of joining your team and playing a role in supporting and guiding students in their Islamic studies. Thank you for considering my application, and I eagerly await the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.

Sharing knowledge and promoting understanding brings people closer to their spiritual journey, fostering purpose and fulfillment. Dawah contributes to the well-being of the Muslim community, fostering unity, compassion, and support. It addresses misconceptions, promotes dialogue, and creates an inclusive environment.\nEngaging in dawah promotes personal growth and learning. It deepens my understanding of Islam, expands my cultural knowledge, and develops effective communication skills. Continuous learning makes me more informed and empathetic, positively impacting others.\nDawah allows me to fulfill my duty as a believer in Islam. Islam emphasizes inviting others to righteousness and spreading goodness. Through dawah activities, I fulfill this responsibility and strive to be a positive example.\nOverall, dawah enables me to give back, promote unity, grow personally, and fulfill religious obligations. By engaging in dawah, I connect humanity with God and positively impact others' lives.","As someone who wants to become more engaged with my Muslim community, I feel that volunteering is an excellent way to give back and make a meaningful contribution. I have felt distant from my community for a while, and I am motivated to get involved and build stronger connections with the people around me.\nRecently, I was inspired by someone who highlighted the importance of community service and its ability to bring people together. Their passion and commitment to making a positive impact made me realize that I too can make a difference by contributing my time and skills to the community.\nFurthermore, I believe that volunteering with iERA will provide me with an opportunity to learn more about my faith and culture. Working with others towards a common goal will enable me to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for the diverse perspectives and experiences within my community. It will also allow me to meet new people and form meaningful connections with individuals who share similar values and goals.\nOverall, volunteering with the iERA aligns with my personal values of service and community engagement. I am interested in any volunteer opportunities available, and I am willing to help with tasks such as event setup, administration, hospitality, or any other duties you may need assistance with.","No","","No","","No","","No","","","Approved",302,"Active","New Muslm Mentor","Mississauga Team ","","","",""],

I study psychology and neuro behaviour there. I’m currently employed with two tutoring companies. I’m passionate about education and have been looking to pursue further Islamic education and volunteering. I’ve volunteered at a Muslim food bank before doing some admin and assembly line work.

There are so many non muslims around the world that want to know the truth but simply don’t have the education or resources to find the right path. My friend from highschool was following Islam without knowing what it really was, she believed in God but didn’t understand why God expected her to practice in certain way, why just believing and trying to be good was not enough. And Allah guided her through our conversations together, Alhamdulillah. It made me realize this happens very often, people are so close and just need that final push. Secondly, there are too many muslims today who don’t understand islam. I have seen many situations where muslims follow Islam because their parents told them to, Where Islam is just seen a shallow obligation without love, understanding, or deep connection. As a result, there are many muslims around me (and around the world honestly) that find themselves lost, going down paths of their desire and neglecting Islam and hiding this from their parents as well. It’s sad and has even lead some people around me to abandon Islam all together. I believe these things people just need a little love from their peers to understand and desire Islam rather than see it as an obligation. ","I’ve been listening to the rerooted podcasts for a while now and I just find all the work being done so inspirational. There are so many educated, passionate, hardworking muslims that get interviewed and it feels wrong to see this and not try to do something as well. I don’t see myself working at that level of course, but I would prefer to get involved in an organization that I admire and look up to than anything else.

I have also volunteered for the Carleton University Muslim Student association's (CUMSA) Islam Awareness week (IAW) where we attended dawah training and then gave dawah on the floor of IAW. In 2022, I was a part of the CUMSA IAW planning team as a booth leader, the Shariah booth, where we designed posters for topics on islam that are crucial to understand but are also very 'popular' with non-muslims so we can answer the questions they may have regarding them. Additionally, I have also been a part of the High Schools Muslim Association (HMA) and have been doing work with them and have learnt a lot along the way. Therefore, in shaa Allah, I am willing to combine all the skills I have gained alhamdulillah and the experience I got into my work in the dawah street.","I am currently studying neuroscience and mental health at carleton university. I am very passionate about the human brain and how it functions, subhan Allah.God’s willing, I will either continue on the neuroscience path and obtain higher education in this field or get into pharmacy or dentistry in sha Allah.

My actions, words and everything I do in front of others should serve as an invitation to Islam and a good example to others. Spreading the message of Islam is so important to me because, now that I understand it alhamdulillah, I want to help everyone around me and make sure we all know that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that he, alone, created us all. It is also my duty as a Muslim to make others aware of this message and alhamdulillah I try to convey the message to my non Muslim friends and colleagues and pray for their guidance. Additionally, since there are so many misconceptions about Islam in the world everywhere, Dawah is very important to me as it breaks down and clears up those misconceptions and make people get a more correct understanding of Islam. Last but not least, one of the reasons why I really love this work is that I am constantly learning things along the way, whether it be learning more about non Muslims and using that knowledge to know how to better talk with them and improve my approach or learning more about Islam and applying that knowledge into my daily life and improving my understanding. Therefore, Dawah is very important to me and I truly believe no Muslim can live without giving it because even the tiniest action or one word matters and could make a difference and no one should ever be stingy with knowledge or kind actions.","I respect how iERA is a platform dedicated to giving Dawah and I have seen some of the street Dawah videos of this organizations and wanted to work with them. iERA provides many opportunities to get engaged with the community and contributes a lot to our community and I really value that and respect it. iERA also fulfils the rights of Muslims to convey the message of Islam respectfully and I would love to be a part of this team and contribute positively to my community.","No","","No","","No","","No","","I agree","Approved","","In Progress","","","","","",""],

I attended the Street Da'wah after our training session, but otherwise my only Da'wah experience is that I used to volunteer with the local AlMaghrib Institute chapter and help organize and set up local community events.","I recently graduated from the Computer Science program at the University of Windsor and am currently looking for a job. I have a few years of experience in customer service, and my passion is storytelling. My goal is to write and publish my own novel series with a Muslim protagonist, and I want to build a business/legacy around doing da'wah through storytelling in various media (in addition to more traditional forms like street da'wah).","Yes, I attended iERA courses ","No, but I attend halaqas and classes ","AlMaghrib Institute","4-Feb","[\"\"General project management\"\",\"\"English writing skills\"\",\"\"Multimedia/Video/Photo shooting\"\",\"\"IT/Networking\"\"]","Da'wah is important to me for several reasons. First of all, it's my duty as a Muslim to share the message of Islam with others to the best of my ability. The Prophet (peace be upon him) taught us that none of us are true believers until we love for our brothers what we love for ourselves. And if I want to go to Jannah, I should want that for everyone else as well.\nBeyond that, it's also important to do da'wah because it's a means of fortifying our knowledge of Islam and our eemaan. Anyone who teaches or tutors others knows that one of the best ways to retain your knowledge and improve your understanding of a topic is by sharing it with others.\nIt's also natural that if you truly love something, you want to share that sense of love and wonder with others. You want them to experience that same relationship you have with the subject of your love. Doing da'wah is a means by which we can share our love of Allah with others, and in shaa Allah nurture and solidify our devotion to Him.\nWhat's more, no human lives in a vacuum. We're always being influenced by others and by society, by what they say and what they do. All around us, there are those who knowingly or unknowingly seek to pull us away from Islam. If I don't actively work to improve and uplift myself, and to hold firm to Islam through worship and da'wah, then I'll automatically begin to decline.\nLearning how to da'wah, and practicing it through volunteering and doing it in person, is a way to defend Islam both for my own heart and for those of others. I can nurture my own relationship with the deen and build my own confidence in practicing it and sharing it with others in shaa Allah. It's a way to protect myself from spiritual decline and reverse my decline into growth.","I want to volunteer with iERA so that I can learn how to give da'wah properly. I want to be able to speak with confidence and with certainty, both about what I'm talking about and about how I'm doing it. I want to go into da'wah-based storytelling in the future. This is da'wah through novels and other forms of media such as TV shows, movies, etc. But I first need to learn the rules of in-person da'wah before I can continue beyond that in shaa Allah.\nI want to counter the common misconceptions about Allah and the concept of divinity that are prevalent in modern pop culture. These media forms are so dominant today in society, especially in the West, yet we see most of them spreading ideas and messages from other cultures that go against the truth of Tawheed and the reality of Allah. There isn't enough representation for the true message of Islam, even in those shows which have nominally Muslim characters. I want to change this in shaa Allah.\nOne of the major things holding me back is my fear of accidentally speaking without knowledge or speaking without wisdom.

","my instagram lady_roseia","Street Dawah ","I've done the dawat training twice with iera and done the practical training at riverside.","I am a genuinely bubbly person and I've been told that by many people, I enjoy a wide range of things such as Horse Riding, Archery, Reading, Cooking and Baking. I'm learning to drive so doing that would be something I'd be doing for fun, motorbikes and cars. I do enjoy playing video games I admit and spending time with my friends. I actually used to make lipglosses and sometimes help my mother to make skin care products too since thats her business! At the moment I work for her too, I do laser hair removal I'm starting head massages and facials(skin care treatments) just like her. For my future aspirations I plan on going into psychology so I do want to learn more about islam and how to give dawat as another way of giving it whenever I reach my goal of becoming a therapist/counselor and/or life coach. Using it in the work field around friends and just being a better muslim myself I want to learn how to be that way so I can even give dawat just by my actions. ","Yes, I attended iERA courses ","No, but I attend halaqas and classes ","It was at the masjids here. I do an Al Huda course thats situated in mississauga though. ","4-Feb","[\"\"People management\"\"]","Dawat is important to me because for my own self I know I could be a better muslim, in order to give dawat to other people and convey islam to them I need to know my religion the best I can. And I believe from helping humanity as a whole connect and get closer to Allah(swt) I myself need to do the same. Killing two birds with one stone in that way. for my personally I went through my phase where I was further from the deen and Alhamdulilah by the grace of Allah I came closer to Him and I know just how depressing and lonely and unfulfilling life is without Him, without being close to him your heart truly does feel empty. So helping people come closer and at least letting them learn about Him, jump starting their journey is something that I would love to do. A sadaqajariya and on top of all of that. Allah will ask me why I didn't do this when I had the means to, the health the money the privilege the community and resources I don't want to come up to him embarrassed with nothing to prove I've done with my life. Giving Dawah to me is as important as getting close to Allah. Because its up to us to help others and inform them, we're going to be answerable to Allah(swt) and shouldn't go empty handed. People have such twisted and confused views on islam due to social media and I don't blame them, for a short while I was confused myself its so difficult learning about whats right and whats wrong who to trust which sources to look at sometimes you get so overwhelmed confused lost and end up giving up. You always hear the rash harsh things about islam before you see the true beauty. And you end up scaring the poor person. So yes its quite important for me to give Dawah and its another way for me to better learn and understand my religion. I feel so disappointed in myself when people ask me questions about islam and I don't have the answer to it. My goal is to  In Shaa Allah confidentally answer every question In Shaa Allah and learn my religion as best as I can so I can do my part in helping the Ummah. ","I've volunteered somewhat for Dawah things before but I find that both times I do it with iERA its been a very good vibe overall, they way the coaches explain things so efficiently and clearly. They don't actually stress you out over this and make you calm relaxed and don't overwhelm you. For the first time when learning about how to give dawah I wasn't shaking nervous about what to do what to say, it was honestly relaxing and quite exciting i felt it during both trainings I've done. They explain things so simply that you don't get confused and you learn how to teach it to others and not to confuse them either. they've broken things down into simple steps that you won't get lost. Alhamdulilah iERA is an amazing organization with the way they've put everything together and I hope to learn more and grow with them In Shaa Allah. JzkAllah Khair for reading all this.

I was struggling immensely with my nafs and I was making lots of Dua. My local masjid then ran a Da'wah workshop. Taking da'wah purified my heart and answered so much Dua. Taking da'wah made me understand what TAWHEED ACTUALLY MEANS! DA'WAH made me realize that through logic and reason alone forget blind faith or feelings that Atheism / Agnostic arguments any argument religious or non religious is disintegrated and refuted. Islam is not a religion. It's a way of life. And that guidance is only in Allah's power. And that Allah SWT was blessing me with knowledge and understanding of my faith and bringing me closer to Him. Dawah answered my dua of surrounding me with the believers and friends of Allah SWT. Da'wah helped click into place that I don't have to feel guilty about leaving. I left everything for Allah SWT The originator of everything! And that I need to be proud to be Muslim. And now I know how to explain my faith in the correct way and not answer their random questions, build the foundation first, that as a revert to Islam, there is a space for me in Da'wah And that there is Khayr in delay. The importance of having  tawaakul, sabr and yaqueen the importance of understanding what it means to have Tawheed.  I want to be a New Muslim Mentor for iERA because I want to give the support that I was given. It's a form of Da'wah! And I think it's the responsibility of every Muslim to learn Da'wah renew their tawheed and call others to Allah Subhanna Wa Ta Ala! May Allah Subhanna Wa Ta Ala continue to bless us all in the Ummah.","I want to volunteer with IERA specifically because I watched a lot of iERAs content before I became Muslim and listening to the ReRooted podcast, discovering that iERA Is created by Reverts to Islam , that the Sahaba were all Reverts! Reverts have an important space and role in the Ummah really warmed my heart and is one of the reasons I love and chose Islam.","No","","No","","No","","No","","I agree","Approved","","In Progress","","","","","",""],

Was it for minding his own business or having a different faith? \nIf the best of mankind suffered through what he did, simply for the sake of giving dawah, we do not have any right to disregard our call towards it, its significance is simply way too high.\nEven at Khaybar, The prophet is sending an army and his commands are to give dawah before engaging in battle...\nI see all these people, lost and empty but I see more gems holding very high potential, some very nice people, some very smart people, extremely honest people but they are unaware about the truth WHILE they live amongst us.
